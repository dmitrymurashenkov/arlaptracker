                <h1>AR lap tracker</h1>

                <p>AR lap tracker is a web tool for tracking laps in FPV drone racing by marking finish line with AR markers/QR codes
                    and recognizing them in VTX video feed. You'll need USB OTG 5.8Ghz video receiver to use it.</p>

                <h2>How to use</h2>

                <p>Print following marker on A4 paper and place it near the finish line.</p>
                <img src="markers/marker-4x4_bch_13_9_3-value-22.png" width="100px" height="100px">

                <p>Use <a href="markers/marker-4x4_bch_13_9_3-value-22.pdf">this pdf</a> to print - marker MUST have white
                    margins around it, otherwise it would be difficult to recognize. Sometimes smaller marker is better
                    and in our tests black area 13x13cm also worked well on A4 paper.</p>

                <p>Connect USB OTG video receiver to your PC - it automatically acts as an ordinary webcam.</p>

                <p>Configure the settings and hit Start race!</p>

                <h2>Settings</h2>

                <p><b>Marker size</b> - the length of black square's side in meters, on A4 from pdf it's
                    usually about 17cm, so input 0.17. This is used to determine distance to the marker
                    and ignore it if it's too far away</p>

                <p><b>Lap finished when distance to marker less than</b> - when drone is near the marker and
                    marker goes out of sight - the app assumes that pilot passed the finish gate. Configure this
                    distance threshold. Note that some cameras have narrow FOV and can't see marker when they
                    are too close to it so be sure to test it on different drones before the race.</p>

                <p>NOTE! At the moment there is a bug, where distance to marker is determined incorrectly and depends
                    on camera FOV. Please adjust this settings for your environment - better just to put higher value
                    in it. The lap finish registration happens based on the distance shown as number overlay and not
                    on the blue box size, although they are expected to be the same if eveything works correctly.</p>

                <p><b>Min lap time</b> - set min lap time to ignore cases when pilot got stuck near the finish
                    gate for some time. Adjust it it the actual length of your track.</p>

                <p><b>Record video</b> - in case of any lap counter errors we want to record video to be able to
                    correct manually after the race. If this option is checked - you'll be asked to choose the
                    browser tab to record and only then the race will start.</p>

                <p>Also this option guards your from accidentally erasing results after race was stopped if you've
                    unintentionally clicked Start race again since you'll need to select screen to record first and
                    only then previous results would be erased.</p>

                <p><b>Countdown</b> - random or fixed countdown can be configured, you'll hear beeps every second
                    and then the start sound.</p>

                <p><b>Camera</b> - connect USB video receiver and select it in this dropdown. In order to remove the
                    device - select Remove pilot option.</p>

                <p><b>Pilot name</b> - pilot name to use when tracking laps to distinguish between several pilots.
                    Make sure all pilots have unique names!</p>

                <h2>Marker placement best practices</h2>

                <p>Before starting the race you should power your drone and point it to the marker - the app should
                    show a blue box where it detects the marker and distance to it. Check if shown distance to marker
                    is correct - otherwise make sure you've set marker size in settings.</p>

                <p>If you don't see the box - make sure your marker is clearly visible through the camera and sheet
                    of paper is not bent - it should be straight. Marker rotation over any axis doesn't matter.</p>

                <p>If marker is partially visible - it won't be recognized. Bear in mind that marker can also be
                    covered by OSD (especially low battery warning later in race!) or VTX noise.</p>

                <p>To increase probability of marker recognition - you can place several markers around the finish
                    gate (just print one same marker several times) - if at least one of them is recognized the
                    lap will be recorded correctly. Although app thinks that only one marker is printed and will shift
                    blue area between them depending on which one is better visible - it doesn't affect lap tracking
                    since in this case marker is still considered constantly visible.</p>

                <p>Marker needs to stay visible on screen and not be too shaky for about 0.5 sec in order to be
                    recognized. When planing track layout a typical option is to have finish gate about 3-5m after 180
                    degree turn so that pilots slow down, face the gate with markers and then approach it in a straight
                    line.</p>

                <h2>Known issues, limitations and compatibility</h2>

                <p>If recording is many minutes long it may consume all memory - not tested currently, but probably
                    will be fixed later.</p>
