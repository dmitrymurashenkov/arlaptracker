Fully web-based. Latest release available at: https://dmitrymurashenkov.github.io/arlaptracker/

You'll need connect USB OTG 5.8Ghz FPV video receiver to PC (it acts as an ordinary webcam),

lap time will be recorded.

This tool inspired by [TinyViewPlus](https://github.com/t-asano/tinyviewplus) which works with 
similar accuracy, but requires installation and is not crossplatform.
